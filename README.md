## How it works?

We ❤️ open-source! That's why we've published more than 100 projects on our GitHub ([**@clue**](https://github.com/clue)).

This GitHub page allows our sponsors to benefit from **exclusive early access** to our projects.
Each sponsor will receive an invitation by email and, once activated, will have full access to all our projects before they are made available to the general public.

In addition, each member of **clue·access** gets **exclusive access to our support channel**.

## Why clue·access?

Because we believe **open-source needs to be sustainable**.
You get the **best out of our projects** – we get sponsors to help us focus on **creating awesome projects**.
Win-win! 💪

We want you to have a chance to be involved in early project development stages.
You get the chance to access our projects before they are made available to the general public and provide early feedback.
We get the chance to collect feedback and know exactly what to focus on next.
Win-win again! 💪

Let's not forget the financial aspect of working on open-source full-time.
More sponsors mean we can spend more time on open-source.
[Sponsorware](https://github.com/sponsorware/docs) is (*you guessed it*) win-win! 💪
